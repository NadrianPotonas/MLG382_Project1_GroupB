Loan Status Prediction Model
This project involves the development of a machine learning model to predict the status of a loan application (approved or denied) based on various applicant attributes such as income, loan amount, credit score, employment status, and other financial indicators. The model aims to assist financial institutions in making more informed decisions on loan approvals.
